API:-->

	=> API stands for Application Programming Interface
	=> APIs specify how one software program should 
		interact with other software programs.
	=> API is a collection of software functions 
		that can be executed by another software program.

	known API's are
		SOAP UI
		RestFull

API Testing:-->

	APIs Can test directly and also as a 
	part of integration testing to check whether the 
	API meets expectations in terms of 
	functionality, reliability, performance, 
	and security of an application

	=> API testing conduct only when multiple
	   API's available at software..
	
	=> API not concentrate on look and feel of the software


	
Advantages of API Testing:
	
	=> API Testing is language independent.
	=> We can test the APIs without a user interface, In
		GUI testing we have to wait until Userinterface developed
	=> Early testing possible need not wait until software is developed.
	


What to verify in API Testing:-->

	Data accuracy
    	HTTP status codes
    	Response time
    	Error codes in case API return any errors
    	Authorization checks
    	Non-functional testing such as performance testing, security testing



API HTTP Request Commands:-->

	1. GET: GET method is used to retrieve data from an API.
	2. POST: POST method is used to send new data to an API
	3. PUT: PUT method is used to update existing data
	4. PATCH: PATCH method is used to update existing data
	5. DELETE : DELETE method is used to remove existing data.
