What is Exception Handling?

Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle 
runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, 
IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

Types of Exceptions:-->

	Checked Exception
	Unchecked Exception
	
	
	1) Checked Exception
		The classes that directly inherit the Throwable 
		class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.

		Example:-->
					IOException,SQL Exception ---etc

	2) Unchecked Exception
			The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are 
			known as unchecked exceptions.
			
			
		Example:-->
					Nullpointer exception, ArithmeticException
					
	Exception keywords:-->
	
		try:-->
				The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where 
				we should place an exception code. It means we 
				can't use try block alone. The try block must be 
				followed by either catch or finally.	
				
				try
				{
						//Write Error Code Here
				}catch(Exception e)
				{
						//Handle erro here
				}
				
				
		 Catch:-->
		 		=> Catch block followed by try block
		 		=> we can use multiple catch blocks to handle
		 			diffenre exception
		 								
					
				try
				{
						//Write Error Code Here
				}catch(NoSuchElementException e)
				{
						//Handle erro here
				}catch(IOException e1)
				{
						//Handle erro here
				}
				
	
	
			finally:-->
					The "finally" block is used to execute the 
					necessary code of the program. It is executed 
					whether an exception is handled or not.
					
				try
				{
						//Write Error Code Here
				}catch(NoSuchElementException e)
				{
						//Handle erro here
				}finally
				{
					    //Finally Code execute whether excpetion
					     available in code or Not available in code	
		        }
					
		
		Throw:-->
				The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
				Don't write any statement after throw condition..
				
				throw new Exception("Descripbe Exception here");
				
				
		Throws:-->
				The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. 
				It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method
				
				public void method1() throws Exception
				{
						Thread.sleep(4000);
				}		
				
				
				public void method1() 
				{
						try
						{
							Thread.sleep(4000);
						}catch(Excpetion e)
						{
						
						}
				}
